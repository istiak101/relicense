# relicense
Re-licensing open source projects with contributors permission.

This tool will try to rewrite entire Git history of a project to
remove one or multiple contributors commit AKA code from the history 
after one or multiple contributors approved re-licensing. This tries
to address cases when getting approval from one or multiple contributor
is not an option. This tool can be used in cases like:

* Contributor died thus can not approve re-licensing
* Unresponsive contributor
* Contributor won't allow re-licensing
* Fork of the main project took different directions
